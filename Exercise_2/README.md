# Complex number

A complex number can be expressed in the form ${\displaystyle a+bi}$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit.

## Example 

a = 1, b = 2

the complex number is: 1 + 2i.

## Requirements

Write a program which creates a ComplexNumber class and implements the following operations:

- writing a complex number on the standard output in the following format: **real + imag i**. For example if $a = 1$ and $b = 2$, program writes **1+2i**. On the other hand, if $a =1$ and $b = -2$, programs write **1-2i**;
- defining the operators **+**, **==**;
- defining a function that computes its conjugate.
